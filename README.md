// Talk about GitKit being a resourceful tool for developers

GitKit is a tool for developers to manage their Git repositories. It is a web application that allows users to create, clone, and delete repositories. It also allows users to view the contents of their repositories and make changes to them.

Dom Gibson is a developer who is passionate about creating tools that make developers' lives easier. He is the creator of GitKit, a tool for managing Git repositories and keeping this website up to date.

## So, What is GitKit?

We can achieve more together than we can alone. GitKit is a tool for developers to understand and learn through documentation on free resources and also providing user-like experience from a ground-based level.

The site is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. With minimal JS and React Experience, I was able to create a website that is easy to use and navigate to help you find what you need and get you back to coding.

Even if it is just a simple website, it is still a website that is built with the intention of helping you. I hope you enjoy your stay here and find something useful.
